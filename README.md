# GitHub Backup Script
This is a simple tool that can be used to maintain backups of repositories both
public and private. Repositories are cloned to a specified destination based on
inclusion from rules in the configuration file.

See config.yml.example for the "persistent" options including the GitHub API
token and the rules to match repositories for backup.
